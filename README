JSCalc is a javascript-based mathematical parser and calculator. 
It allows one to type math naturally and have it do the right thing.

==Features==
 * Implicit multiplication: '4pi' is recognized as '4*pi'
 * Prefix, infix, and suffix operations: 'sin(4)', '4^4', '4!'
 * Bracket agnostic: use '()', '{}', or '[]' to group expressions.  They can be mixed aswell!
 * Order of operations respected (If it weren't, it'd be a pretty bad calculator)

==Requirements==
Javascript 1.8. (For example, FireFox 4 > or gnome-javascript)

Why?

New javascript builtins like 'let', destructured assignments, etc. are just 
too painful to work without.
